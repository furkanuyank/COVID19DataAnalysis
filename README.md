## CENG313 - Introduction to Data Science Assignmet

Some basic data analysis methods coded in the assignment attached above.
These can be listed as follows:

  - Datasets for FIM and Rule extraction.
  - Mising values were filled with KNN.
  - Clinical Cases Predicted by Decision Tree and KNNeighbors methods.
  - PCA was applied to reduce the number of features from 18 to 2 and then the Decision Boundaries for both methods are shown.
  - ROC curves were drawn for both methods.
  - Finally, the performance of the Decision Tree and KNNeighbors methods in this case is compared.
